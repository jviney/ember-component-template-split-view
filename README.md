# Ember Component / Template Split View

Super simple Sublime Text plugin that will let you open corresponding template or route files with EmberJS components. 

Built because I have probably spent 30% of my workday typing CMD+P "fileNameblah/template" and the like.

## How To Install

The package is pending submission into [Sublime Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Once available, installing via Package Control is recommended. Youcan also clone this reposoitory into your packages folder (by default: /Users/{user}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages).

## How To Use

Open any component's component.js file or template.hbs file, then press *CTRL+SHIFT+K* to open it's corresponding template or javascript file in another window.
